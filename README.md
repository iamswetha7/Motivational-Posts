Hey there! I'm Swetha, and I'm passionate about all things cybersecurity and cloud. With each step of my journey, I've learned the power of determination, resilience, and continuous learning. 

## Motivation

Life is an incredible journey filled with ups and downs, successes and challenges. Remember, every obstacle is an opportunity to learn and grow. Embrace challenges with open arms and let them shape you into a stronger version of yourself.

> "Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts." - Winston Churchill

**Believe in yourself and your dreams.** Don't let self-doubt hold you back. Your potential is limitless, and you have the power to achieve anything you set your mind to.

> "The future depends on what you do today." - Mahatma Gandhi
